### What I learned

I came to understand inside a selector in css i can have another selector.
see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm <a href="google.com">googling</a> about.</h1>
```
```css
h1:hover {
  background-color: papayawhip;
  
  a {
	color: blue;
  }
}
```


### Continued development

I am still look at learn how to implement responsive designs

### Useful resources

- [Learn HTML!](https://web.dev/learn/html/) - This helped would help you with basic html
- [Learn CSS!](https://web.dev/learn/css/) - Another excellent (and free!) course from web.dev. This introduction to CSS is written and edited by a host of CSS experts. If you work through this course, you'll have excellent foundational knowledge.
